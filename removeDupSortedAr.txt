Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array 2
medium
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique elements appears at most twice.
The relative order of the elements shouldbe kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the arry in some languages you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums.
More formally, if there are 'k' elements after removing the duplicates, then thefirst k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements
